# Pasadena Environmental Justice Web Application
This is a Webb App designed to support the city of Pasadena's Environmental Justice Element to their General Plan. As input, residents can write their street address. The output will be their census tract, which is automatically highlighted. 

Further, residents can decide what type of metric they are interested in showing: CalEnviroScreen's overall score, or the Pollution Burden or Population Characteristic sub-scores. An interactive map displays their metric of choice. Further, the indicators that comprise the relevant score are displayed for the individual's census tract.  

We hope that easy access to environmental justice metrics can help make residents more aware of the vulnerabilities they have to climate change, while providing accessible data for them to advocate for themselves. Likewise, we hope these maps can help in city planning, to prioritize fair and just provision of city funds and projects.
