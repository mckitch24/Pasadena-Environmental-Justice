# Pasadena-Environmental-Justice
 This is a Webb App designed to support the city of Pasadena's Environmental Justice Element to their General Plan. As input, residents can decide which metric they would like to display, and where they live. 


We hope that easy access to environmental justice metrics can help make residents more aware of the vulnerabilities they have to climate change, while providing accessible data for them to advocate for themselves. Likewise, we hope these maps can help in city planning, to prioritize fair and just provision of city funds and projects.
